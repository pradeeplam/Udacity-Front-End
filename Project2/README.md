## Description

Created an interactive(albiet bare-bones) landing page template with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS to practice
JavaScript (Specifically with using JavaScript to interact w/ DOM).

Page comes with 3 sections hard-coded into the HTML and one generated using JavaScript (4 sections total).

The navbar on top will allow user to scroll to specific section. The navbar sticks to the top as the user scrolls 
and is coded to automatically disapper if user stops scrolling for 2 seconds (Will reappear once user resumes scrolling).

Sections will become highlighted (Background fades black w/ background animations playing) when section is marked active
(within center of view).


## Usage

index.html contains the main (and only) page. Once there, begin scrolling or click on a nav-bar button to scroll down to
a specific section.

## Dependencies

Uses external google fonts api, but no other dependencies are required.
